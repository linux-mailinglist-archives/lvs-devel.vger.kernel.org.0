	This is how ipvsadm -S runs now, list_all() gets all
services and for each gets its destinations.

	It depends on its complexity, are you changing
the ipvsadm -S code or just the kernel part?

	No, sockopt is old interface and it is not changed,
it lacks IPv6 support, etc.

	You can post it with [PATCH RFC] tag, so that we
can see how do you mix services and destinations in same
packet. You can also add speed comparison after the --- line
for more information.
